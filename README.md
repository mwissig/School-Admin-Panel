# School Admin Panel

See [On Heroku](https://sat-panel.herokuapp.com/)

This is an administrative panel for a school made in Rails.

The users in this app are randomly generated using Faker, with the password set to "password." You can log in to the account of any Faker-generated user using their email address and "password." There are three levels of administrative privilege: Instructor, Administrator, and President, each having different abilities.

Log in as an admin:

Email: sidzieme@smitham.name

password: password


Log in as an instructor: 

Email: alexis@hamill.info

password: password
